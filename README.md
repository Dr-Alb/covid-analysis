🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is a data analysis and visualization notebook that explores global COVID-19 trends using real-world data. It tracks and compares COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations across different countries over time.

📌 Objectives

- Import and clean COVID-19 data from a reliable global dataset.
- Analyze time trends of cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Compare key metrics across selected countries (e.g., Kenya, USA, India).
- Visualize trends using line charts and optional choropleth maps.
- Communicate key findings through visualizations and narrative insights.

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly (optional, for choropleth map)
▶️ How to Run the Project

1. **Download the dataset**:  
   Get the latest [`owid-covid-data.csv`](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-data) from Our World in Data and place it in the project folder.

2. **Run the notebook**:
   - Open `COVID19_Global_Data_Tracker.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with the Jupyter extension.
   - Run each cell sequentially to load, clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

3. **Optional**: Export the final report as PDF using Jupyter's "Export As" feature.

## 💡 Insights & Reflections

- India reported the highest number of total cases among the selected countries.
- The United States led early vaccination efforts but still saw surges in cases.
- Kenya had lower case and death numbers but a relatively consistent death rate.
- Vaccination rollout significantly accelerated in 2021, but plateaued in later years.
- Daily new case patterns reveal waves that align with known COVID-19 variants.
